# Image2Shape

1. The lmdbs used in this experiment are `oct_test_lmdb`, `oct_train_lmdb`, 
   `img_test_lmdb` and `img_train_lmdb`,  which are generated by the script 
   `caffe/experiments/prepare_dataset.py`. Please refer to the instructions
   [here](autoencoder.md#autoencoder-on-caffe)
  
2. Download the protocol  buffer files `caffe/experiments/image2shape.train.prototxt` 
   and `caffe/experiments/image2shape.solver.prototxt`. 
   Configure the training and tesing lmdb files and training the network.
   
3. After training, download the protocol buffer file `caffe/experiments/image2shape.test.prototxt` 
   to testing the network.
